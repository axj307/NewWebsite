    description: |1-
        * **Sparse-Collocation based Optimal Control of Vehicles using Hamilton-Jacobi Equation:** 
            * Developed a Semi-Analytical (SA) methodology to obtain a canonical transformation that rectifies the flow of a dynamical system
            * Solved the Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) using Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE)
            * Utilized Sparse Approximation method to fit a surface around collocation points
            * ‚óè	Verified the SA solution with the open-loop solution using bvp4c in MATLAB
        * **Stochastic Reachability Analysis using Sparse-Collocation Method:** 
            * Reachability analysis of a general non-linear system is computed due to the presence of uncertainties in the initial condition, control input and external disturbances
            * Collocation based method is used to approximate the transition probability density function (pdf) at any given time
            * Utilized Sparse Approximation method to fit a surface around collocation points, which are computed through the non-product quadrature method known as the Conjugate Unscented Transformation (CUT) method
            * Utilized minimum set of polynomial expansion as a convex optimization problem to find the sparse approximation solution
        * **Stochastic Reachability Analysis for the Hypersonic Re-entry Problem:** 
            * Used CUT method to drive the uncertainty in the initial state and control input to compute the reachability set for the hypersonic reentry vehicle
            * Multi-dimensional expectation integrals are computed using CUT quadrature to obtain statistical moments
            * Numerical results are computed for two different maneuvers and are verified using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
        * **Computationally Efficient Approach for Stochastic Reachability Set Analysis:** 
            * Formulated the problem of computing reachability set of a system in a probabilistic manner
            * Utilized the Convolution and Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME) techniques to find the pdf of a system at any given time
            * Verified numerical results using MC simulations
        * **An Optimal Trajectory Planning Based on Load Distribution for a Multi-lift System:** 
            * Developed an optimal trajectory planning method for a multi-lift system using direct and indirect collocation method
            * Applied direct collocation-based method to find a solution
            * Implemented indirect collocation-based method to verify the solution obtained from the direct collocation method
            * Used non-linear solvers such as fmincon and fsolve to solve the optimization problem
